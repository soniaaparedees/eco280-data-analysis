# data-analysis

In this project, I used US household demographic characteristics from the 2019 American Housing Survey Public Use File (PUF) to explore their relationships with homeownership. 

# Running the analysis

Please run `import.rmd` to import data. Then run `data_analysis.Rmd` for the analysis.
